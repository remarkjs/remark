## What is this?

This package is a [unified][] processor with support for parsing markdown input
and serializing markdown as output by using unified with
[`remark-parse`][remark-parse] and [`remark-stringify`][remark-stringify].

Please see the [monorepo readme][remark] for what the remark ecosystem is.

**unified** is a project that transforms content with abstract syntax trees
(ASTs).
**remark** adds support for markdown to unified.
**mdast** is the markdown AST that remark uses.

## When should I use this?

You can use this package when you want to use unified, have markdown as input,
and want markdown as output.
You can alternatively use unified itself and use [`remark-parse`][remark-parse]
and [`remark-stringify`][remark-stringify] to do the same.
You should also use unified directly with either of those plugins when the input
you have or output you want is not markdown.

When you want to inspect and format markdown files in a project on the command
line, you can use [`remark-cli`][remark-cli].

If you *just* want to turn markdown into HTML (with maybe a few extensions),
we recommend [`micromark`][micromark] instead.

## Install

This package is [ESM only](https://gist.github.com/sindresorhus/a39789f98801d908bbc7ff3ecc99d99c).
In Node.js (version 12.20+, 14.14+, or 16.0+), install with [npm][]:

```sh
npm install remark
```

In Deno with [Skypack][]:

```js
import {remark} from 'https://cdn.skypack.dev/remark@14?dts'
```

In browsers with [Skypack][]:

```html
<script type="module">
  import {remark} from 'https://cdn.skypack.dev/remark@14?min'
</script>
```

## Use

Say we have the following module `example.js`:

```js
import {remark} from 'remark'
import remarkGfm from 'remark-gfm'
import remarkToc from 'remark-toc'

main()

async function main() {
  const file = await remark()
    .use(remarkGfm)
    .use(remarkToc)
    .process('# Hi\n\n## Table of contents\n\n## Hello\n\n*Some* ~more~ _things_.')

  console.error(String(file))
}
```

Running that with `node example.js` yields:

```markdown
# Hi

## Table of contents

*   [Hello](#hello)

## Hello

*Some* ~~more~~ *things*.
```

## API

This package exports the following identifier: `remark`.
There is no default export.

### `remark()`

Create a new (unfrozen) unified processor that already uses `remark-parse` and
`remark-stringify` and you can add more plugins to.
See [`unified`][unified] for more information.

## Syntax

Markdown is parsed and serialized according to CommonMark.
Other plugins can add support for syntax extensions.

## Syntax tree

The syntax tree format used in remark is [mdast][].

## Types

This package is fully typed with [TypeScript][].
There are no extra exported types.

## Compatibility

Projects maintained by the unified collective are compatible with all maintained
versions of Node.js.
As of now, that is Node.js 12.20+, 14.14+, and 16.0+.
Our projects sometimes work with older versions, but this is not guaranteed.

## Security

As markdown can be turned into HTML and improper use of HTML can open you up to
[cross-site scripting (XSS)][xss] attacks, use of remark can be unsafe.
When going to HTML, you will likely combine remark with **[rehype][]**, in which
case you should use [`rehype-sanitize`][rehype-sanitize].

Use of remark plugins could also open you up to other attacks.
Carefully assess each plugin and the risks involved in using them.
