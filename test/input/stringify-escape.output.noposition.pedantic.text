Characters that should be escaped in general:

\\ \` \* \[ \_

Characters that shouldn't:

{}]()#+-.!>"$%',/:;=?@^~

Underscores are always \_escaped\_, even when they appear in\_the\_middle\_of\_a\_word.

Ampersands are escaped only when they would otherwise start an entity:

-   &amp;copycat &amp;amp; &amp;#x26
-   But: Â©cat; `&between;` &foo; & AT&T &c

Open parenthesis should be escaped after a shortcut reference:

[ref]\(text)

\- not a list item
\- not a list item
  \+ not a list item

Same for angle brackets:

\> not a block quote

And hash signs:

\# not a heading
  \## not a subheading

Text under a shortcut reference should be preserved verbatim:

-   [two*three]
-   [two\*three]
-   [a\a]
-   [a\\a]
-   [a\\\a]
-   [a_a\_a]
