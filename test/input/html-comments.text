Paragraph one.

<!-- This is a simple comment -->

<!--
	This is another comment.
-->

What follows is not an HTML comment because it contains
two consecutive dashes:
<https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/syntax.html#comments>.

<!-- one comment block -- -- with two comments -->

But this is fine (in commonmark):

<!-- one comment block - with a dash -->

And, this is wrong (in commonmark):

<!-->-->

The end.
