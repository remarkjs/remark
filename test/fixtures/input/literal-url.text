# Literal URLs

## Extended www “autolinks”

Here’s a URL: www.alpha.org.

Visit www.bravo.org/help for more information.

Dots cannot appear together: www..one.com and www.two..com.

And www. is not a URL, neither are www.a nor www.b.

Underscores cannot be used in the last two domain parts, so www.three.c_m,
and www.fo_ur.com are not URLs, but www.fi_ve.six.com is.

Valid, and the dot is not part of the link: Visit www.charlie.org.

Valid, and this dot isn’t part of the link either: Visit www.delta.org/a.b.

Valid, but two dots are both not part of the URL: www.example.com..

Here are parens: www.echo.com/search?q=Markup+(business)

The last two aren’t part of the
link: www.foxtrot.com/search?q=golf+(hotel)))

These first and last ones aren’t
either: (www.india.com/search?q=juliett+(kilo))

This last one is: (www.lima.com/search?q=mike+(november)

Paren counting is only done if the last character is a closing
paren: www.google.com/search?q=(business))+ok

If it “looks” like an entity at the end, it isn’t included.

This is a whole URL: www.entity.com/search?q=alpha&hl=en

This is a without the semicolon: www.entity.com/search?q=bravo&;

This one is without the “entity”: www.entity.com/search?q=charlie&hl;

This one one too: www.entity.com/search?q=delta&copy;

Only “named” ones work, numericals don’t, so this one is only without the
semicolon: www.entity.com/search?q=delta&#x220A;

`<` immediately ends an autolink: www.alpha.org/he<lp
