If the info string comes after a backtick fence, it may not contain any backtick
characters.
The reason for this restriction is that otherwise some inline code would be
incorrectly interpreted as the beginning of a fenced code block.

Tildes in info strings are fine:

```js filename=~/.bashrc
console.log(1)
```

Tildes in info strings are fine after tilde fences:

~~~js filename=~/.bashrc
console.log(1)
~~~

Backticks in info strings are fine after tilde fences:

~~~js title=`.bashrc`
console.log(1)
~~~

Backticks in info strings are **not** fine after backtick fences:

```js title=`.bashrc`
console.log(1)
```
