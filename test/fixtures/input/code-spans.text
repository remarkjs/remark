`<test a="` content of attribute `">`

Fix for backticks within HTML tag: <span attr='`ticks`'>like this</span>

Here's how you put `` `backticks` `` in a code span.

Empty code spans are not supported: ``.

Hereâ€™s an example, `` foo ` bar  ``.

And here, ` `` `.

``
// this is also inline code
``

So is this `foo   bar
  baz`.

And this `foo `` bar`

And `this\`but this is text`.

Whitespace only: ` `.

Whitespace only: `    `.

Whitespace only: `
`.
