This should be a link: http://example.com/hello-world.

Also, subdomain should be a part of the link (http://foo.example.com/(hello[world])).

So should this: mailto:foo@bar.com.

And even with underscore http://domain.org/this_is_good.

All links should work http://a.b, https://c.d, http://e.f, https://g.h.
