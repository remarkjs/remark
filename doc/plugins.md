# Plugins

**remark** plugins lie at the core of **remark**’s vision. As they operate on
the same syntax tree, there is no start-up time penalty when using more than
one plug-in: something which traditional tools, which need to re-compile
to markdown to connect together need.

See [tools built with remark »](https://github.com/wooorm/remark/blob/master/doc/products.md).

## Using plugins

See [**remarkplugin**(7)](https://github.com/wooorm/remark/blob/master/doc/remarkplugin.7.md)
for more information on using plugins.

## Creating plugins

See [**remarkplugin**(3)](https://github.com/wooorm/remark/blob/master/doc/remarkplugin.3.md)
for more information on creating plugins.

## Publishing plugins

It is recommended to publish a plugin as an
[npm module](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/publishing-npm-packages).

You should pick a name prefixed by `"remark-"`, valid examples are
[`remark-toc`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/remark-toc) or
[`remark-yaml-config`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/remark-yaml-config).
The reasoning here is that they can be used on the CLI without this prefix,
but can still be meaningful. For example, `lint` was not available, but instead
of opting for `liiint` or some other weird form, using `remark-lint` ensured a
unique name on package managers, while still being meaningful to users.

Additionally, when the library could be used in the browser, I recommend
publishing at least to [Component](https://github.com/componentjs/guide/blob/master/creating-components/publishing.md).
This will also make a package usable by [Duo](https://github.com/duojs/duo).

When publishing a plugin, you should utilize the package manager’s keywords
functionality and include `"remark"` in the list.
