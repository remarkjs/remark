# Plugins

**remark** plug-ins lie at the core of **remark**’s vision.  As they work
on the same syntax tree, no start-up time penalty is inflicted when using
more than one plug-in: something which traditional tools, which need to
re-compile to markdown to connect together need.

See [tools built with remark »][products].

## List of Utilities

See [**MDAST**][mdast-util] for a list of utilities for working with
the AST.  See [`unist`][unist-util] for other utilities which work with
**MDAST** nodes, too.

And finally, see [`wooorm/vfile`][vfile-util] for a list of utilities
for working with virtual files and

## Using plugins

To use a plug-in programmatically, invoke the [`use()`][unified-use]
function.

To use plug-in with `remark-cli`, pass a [`--use` flag][unified-args-use]
or specify it in a [configuration file][config-file-use].

## Creating plugins

First, read up on the [concept of plug-ins][unified-plugins].
Then, I suggest taking one of existing [plug-ins][plugins], which looks
similar to what you’re about to do, and work from there.  If you get
stuck, [issues][] and [Gitter][] are good places to get help.

A good place for publishing plug-ins is [npm][npm-publish].

You should pick a name prefixed by `"remark-"`, such as
[`remark-lint`][remark-lint].  The reasoning here is that they can be
used on the CLI without this prefix, but can still be meaningful.  For
example, `lint` was not available, but instead of opting for `liiint`
or some other weird form, using `remark-lint` ensured a unique name on
package managers, while still being meaningful to users.

When publishing a plug-in, you should use the package manager’s keywords
functionality and include `"remark"` in the list.
