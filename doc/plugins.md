## List of plugins

See [`awesome-remark`][awesome-remark] for the most awesome projects in the
ecosystem.
More plugins can be found on GitHub tagged with the
[`remark-plugin` topic][topic].

> 👉 **Note**: some plugins don’t work with recent versions of remark due to
> changes in its underlying parser (micromark).
> Plugins that are up to date or unaffected are marked with `🟢` while plugins
> that are **currently broken** are marked with `⚠️`.

> 💡 **Tip**: remark plugins work with markdown and **rehype** plugins work with
> HTML.
> See rehype’s [List of plugins][rehype-plugins] for more plugins.

## List of presets

Use [GitHub search][github-preset-search] to find available and often
inspirational presets.

## List of utilities

See [mdast][mdast-util] for a list of utilities that work with the syntax
tree.
See [unist][unist-util] for other utilities which work with **mdast** and other
syntax trees too.
Finally, see [vfile][vfile-util] for a list of utilities working with virtual
files.

## Use plugins

To use a plugin programmatically, call the [`use()`][unified-use] function.
To use plugin with `remark-cli`, pass a [`--use` flag][unified-args-use] or
specify it in a [configuration file][config-file-use].

## Create plugins

To create a plugin, first read up on the [concept of plugins][unified-plugins].
Then, read the [guide on “Creating a plugin with unified”][guide].
Finally, take one of existing plugins, which looks similar to what you’re about
to make, and work from there.
If you get stuck, [discussions][] is a good place to get help.

You should pick a name prefixed by `'remark-'` (such as `remark-lint`).
**Do not use the `remark-` prefix** if the thing you create doesn’t work with
`remark().use()`: it isn’t a “plugin” and will confuse users.
If it works with mdast, use `'mdast-util-'`, if it works with any unist tree,
use `unist-util-`, and if it works with virtual files, use `vfile-`.

Use default exports to expose plugins from your packages, add `remark-plugin`
keywords in `package.json`, add a `remark-plugin` topic to your repo on GitHub,
and create a pull request to add the plugin here on this page!
