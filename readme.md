**remark** is an ecosystem of [plugins][] for processing markdown.
It’s not another markdown to HTML compiler.  It can generate
and reformat markdown too.  Powered by [plugins][] to do
all kinds of things: [check markdown code style][remark-lint],
[transform safely to React][remark-react],
[add a table of contents][remark-toc], or
[compile to man pages][remark-man].

It’s built on [unified][], make sure to read it and its [website][] too.

*   [`remark`][api] — Programmatic interface
*   [`remark-cli`][cli] — Command-line interface

Oh, and [plugins][]?!
