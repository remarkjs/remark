Hi!  👋 Exciting that you’re interested in contributing!  Before doing so, take
a moment to read the following guidelines.  And thanks for contributing to
**remark**!  👏👌✨

Before anything else: people involved with this project often do so for fun,
next to their day job: you are not entitled to free customer service.

## Ecosystem

The ecosystem consists of several organisations and separate projects: most of
them are tiny, and many of them have a utility
([`mdast-util-to-hast`][mdast-util-to-hast]), a plugin
([`remark-rehype`][remark-rehype]), and relate to an ecosystem
([`remark`][remark]).  Try and pick the right place to contribute to so we can
help you faster.

## Contributions

There’s several ways to contribute, not just by writing code.

### Improve documentation

As a user of this project you’re perfect for helping us improve our docs.
Typo corrections, error fixes, better explanations, new examples, etcetera.
Anything!

### Improve issues

Some issues lack information, aren’t reproducible, or are just incorrect.
Help make them easier to resolve.

### Give feedback on issues

We’re always looking for more opinions on discussions in the issue tracker.

### Write code

Code contributions are very welcome.  It’s often good to first create an issue
to report a bug or suggest a new feature before creating a pull request to
prevent you from doing unnecessary work.

## Submitting an issue

*   The issue tracker is for issues.  Use chat for support
*   Search the issue tracker (including closed issues) before opening a new
    issue
*   Ensure you’re using the latest version of projects
*   Use a clear and descriptive title
*   Include as much information as possible: steps to reproduce the issue,
    error message, version, operating system, etcetera
*   The more time you put into an issue, the more we will
*   The best issue report is a [failing test][unit-test] proving it

## Submitting a pull request

*   Non-trivial changes are often best discussed in an issue first, to prevent
    you from doing unnecessary work
*   For ambitious tasks, you should try to get your work in front of the
    community for feedback as soon as possible
*   New features should be accompanied with tests and documentation
*   Don’t include unrelated changes
*   Lint and test before submitting code by running `$ npm test`
*   Write a convincing description of why we should land your pull request:
    it’s your job to convince us
